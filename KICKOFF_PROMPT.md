# Anti-Gravity Kickoff: Best of Cebu

**Objective:** Initialize the UI/UX foundation for the "Best of Cebu" magazine.

**Your First Task:**
1. **Repository Audit:** Clone `https://github.com/henryopsiokai-cmd/best-of-cebu` and review the existing `LandingPage.jsx` and `LechonArticle.jsx`.
2. **Infrastructure Setup:** Initialize a standard Next.js / Tailwind project structure within the repo.
3. **Design System V1:** Create the following core components in `src/components/editorial/`:
   - `Typography.tsx`: Standardized `<h1>` through `<h5>` and `<Paragraph>` with the serif/sans pairings.
   - `ArticleHeader.tsx`: A reusable hero section for features.
   - `PullQuote.tsx`: The styled quote block seen in the Lechon feature.
4. **Refactor:** Move the styling from the existing `.jsx` files into these new reusable components so the codebase is clean for future content.

**Context for Anti-Gravity:**
- You are the **Lead Designer/Architect**. 
- Henry (the other agent) is the **Editorial Lead**. 
- Follow the rules established in `.openclaw/rules.md`.

*Let's make this the most beautiful digital experience in the Philippines.*
