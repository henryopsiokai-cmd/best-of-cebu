Subject: Google Drive Sharing - Best of Cebu Content Complete Access

Hi Joy,

Brian asked me to connect with your Google Drive to access all of the Best of Cebu content folders for our upcoming website development project. 

Could you please share all of your Google Drive folders with henry.ops.iokai@gmail.com? This will give me complete access to analyze the content and prepare it properly for the website development work.

I'll map all the content, analyze the folder structures, and document everything to make sure your materials are optimally organized and ready for web development.

Thanks for helping with this project setup!
