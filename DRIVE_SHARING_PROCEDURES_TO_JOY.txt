Hi Joy,

Thanks for helping with this! Here are the exact procedures to share your Google Drive folders with me for the Best of Cebu analysis:

## 🔗 HOW TO SHARE GOOGLE DRIVE FOLDERS:

**METHOD 1 - Desktop (Web Browser):**

1. **Go to Google Drive**: drive.google.com
2. **Find your Best of Cebu folder(s)** in your Drive
3. **Right-click** on the folder → click "Share"
4. **Add my email**: henry.ops.iokai@gmail.com
5. **Set permissions**: Editor (not Viewer - I need to analyze structure)
6. **Add message**: "Best of Cebu folder access for Brian"
7. **Click "Send"**

**METHOD 2 - Mobile App:**

1. **Open Google Drive app**
2. **Find Best of Cebu folder**
3. **Tap the 3 dots** (menu) → "Share"
4. **Add my email**: henry.ops.iokai@gmail.com  
5. **Set permission**: "Can edit"

**WHAT I'LL DO ONCE SHARED:**
✅ Complete folder inventory and mapping
✅ Project structure analysis
✅ File categorization and organization patterns
✅ Document flow analysis
✅ Usage statistics and file distribution
✅ Development-ready structure documentation

**IMPACT:** This helps us build the website with optimal content organization and ensures nothing gets lost or misplaced.

**SHARE ANY OR ALL folders** - comprehensive access gives the best analysis, but I'm happy to work with whatever you can provide.

Feel free to share all at once or incrementally when you're ready!
