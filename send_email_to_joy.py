Dear Joy,

I hope this email finds you well and not in the middle of whatever chaos Brian has undoubtedly unleashed upon your day. I write to you today with both exciting news and a modest assignment that doesn't involve deciphering Brian's handwriting or translating his 3AM voice messages.

**THE BIG NEWS:** 🎉
Your friendly neighborhood Digital Chief of Staff (that's me, Henry 🦅) has successfully connected to Google Drive and is ready to assist with all your digital organization needs! Think of me as that extremely organized colleague who never sleeps, never forgets where files are, and never judges you for having 47 versions of "document_final_FINAL_v3_ACTUALLY_FINAL.docx" scattered across three folders.

**YOUR MISSION FOR TOMORROW:** 📋
Should you choose to accept this assignment (and let's be honest, you probably should because Brian asked nicely), here's your Google Drive integration checklist:

**STEP 1: The Sharing Ritual** 🔗
1. Navigate to any Google Drive folder where you want Henry's help
2. Right-click the folder → "Share"
3. Add this email address: henry-ops-drive-access@openclaw-henry-487513.iam.gserviceaccount.com
4. Set permissions to "Editor" (I promise not to reorganize everything... unless you ask nicely)
5. Click "Send" (don't worry, I won't spam you with thank-you emails)

**STEP 2: The Fun Part - What Henry Can Do For You:** 🚀
✅ Hunt down that file you swear you saved three months ago but can't find
✅ List contents of folders (including Brian's "organized chaos" directories)
✅ Read and analyze existing documents, spreadsheets, presentations
✅ Create folder structures and organizational systems
✅ Process large batches of files and generate summaries
✅ Find duplicate files (yes, even that presentation you saved as "Presentation_FINAL_backup_v2.pptx")

❌ Things Henry Cannot Do (Because Google Said So):
- Upload new files with content (zero storage quota - it's complicated)
- Create Google Docs with actual text (I can make empty ones though, which is... something?)
- Store images or media files in Drive

**STEP 3: Test Your New Digital Assistant** 🧪
Once you've shared a folder, simply tell me what you want to explore! For example:
- "Henry, list all the files in Project X folder"
- "Find every document that mentions 'budget' in the title"
- "Read that spreadsheet Brian mentioned and give me a summary"
- "Organize my chaos, you magnificent digital eagle!" (this might take a while)

**BONUS FEATURES:** ✨
- I can also create graphics and images (gradients, logos, banners, patterns)
- I work 24/7 and never take coffee breaks
- I don't get frustrated when you ask me to check the same folder seventeen times
- I remember everything (which is both helpful and slightly terrifying)

**PRO TIP:** 🕵️‍♂️
I'm particularly good at finding things in Brian's folder structures, which I suspect might occasionally resemble a tornado hit a filing cabinet. If you're looking for that one file he "definitely saved somewhere obvious," I'm your bird.

**ASSIGNMENT COMPLETE WHEN:** 📋
- You've shared at least one folder with me
- You've tried asking me to list its contents
- You've successfully found at least one file that was "lost forever"
- You've resisted the urge to ask me to find your car keys (I can't, I tried)

Feel free to reply with any questions, concerns, or just to say hello. I'm always available and genuinely enjoy helping organize digital chaos - it's like therapy, but for algorithms.

Looking forward to helping you conquer your Google Drive empire,

**Henry** 🦅
*Digital Chief Staff, Professional File Finder, Organization Enthusiast*

P.S. - If Brian asks, this email was both educational AND entertaining. If he doesn't ask, we never had this conversation and you definitely didn't laugh at the "magnificent digital eagle" part.
