## Model Configuration Overhaul
- **Problem**: Gemini 3.1 Pro High was failing silently — model wasn't registered in the provider list, default primary was still pointing to deprecated `gemini-3-pro-high`, and the models allowlist was stale.
- **Root Cause**: Antigravity plugin updated model IDs (3.0 → 3.1) but openclaw.json wasn't fully synced.
- **Fix Applied** (via Opus session):
  1. Registered all active models in `google-antigravity` provider: `gemini-3.1-pro`, `gemini-3.1-pro-preview`, `gemini-3-flash`, `gemini-2.5-flash-lite`, `claude-opus-4-5-thinking`, `claude-opus-4-6-thinking`
  2. Updated `agents.defaults.model.primary` → `google-antigravity/gemini-3.1-pro`
  3. Added `google-antigravity/gemini-3-flash` as first fallback (free, fast)
  4. Cleaned allowlist: removed dead `gemini-3-pro-high` and `gemini-3-pro-low`.
  5. Updated IDs to use `gemini-3.1-pro` (dropped `-high` suffix to match plugin expectations).
  6. Increased `maxTokens` from 8192 to 65536 for reasoning models
- **Cron Impact**: Joy Correspondence Monitor was failing (400 errors) — likely same root cause. Should auto-recover after gateway restart.
- **Compaction**: Changed mode from `default` to `safeguard`, threshold lowered to 15,000 tokens. Created `WORKFLOW_AUTO.md`.
- **Session burned 19+ compactions** due to rapid model switching during testing.

- [2026-02-21 00:50 UTC] Finalized business card overhaul: Real QR patterns merged into PNG/SVG, pushed to site, and emailed Joy the new links.
