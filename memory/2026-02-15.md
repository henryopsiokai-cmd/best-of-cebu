# Henry's Daily Log - 2026-02-15

## Session Start
- Memory system analysis initiated by Brian
- Examining existing memory infrastructure
- Implementing comprehensive persistent memory skills

## Tasks Completed
- [x] Analysis of current memory system configuration
- [x] Identified critical memory gaps (no MEMORY.md file)
- [x] Created comprehensive memory analysis report
- [x] **DISCOVERY**: Memory system missing core persistence mechanisms
- [x] **DISCOVERY**: No heartbeat state tracking exists
- [x] Established MEMORY.md with Brian's curated intelligence
- [x] Created heartbeat-state.json for continuity tracking
- [x] Built memory_manager.py for automated consolidation
- [x] **DISCOVERY**: Only 2 daily logs exist (2025-02-15, 2026-02-09)
- [x] Implemented HenryMemoryManager with specialized extraction
- [x] Created SKILL_MEMORY_SYSTEM.md documentation
- [x] **SUCCESS**: Comprehensive memory system deployed

## Key Discoveries
★ Existing daily logs show Brian is radiologist with teleradiology company  
★ Google Drive service account has 0-byte quota (fundamental constraint)  
★ Gmail integration working successfully  
★ ImageMagick available for graphics creation  
★ Brian values direct, data-driven communication  
★ Current location: Taiwan (UTC+8), splits time across 3 countries  

## Memory System Infrastructure
- **Daily Logs**: Automatic capture in memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md
- **Long-term Memory**: MEMORY.md with curated intelligence  
- **Heartbeat State**: Persistent tracking in heartbeat-state.json
- **Manager Tool**: Python-based automation for consolidation
- **Security Protocol**: MEMORY.md only for main sessions

## Brian's Profile Extracted
- **Profession**: Physician (Radiologist) + Entrepreneur
- **Business**: Remote Imaging Consultants (teleradiology)
- **Technical Level**: Peer-level infrastructure knowledge
- **Communication**: Direct, concise, values efficiency
- **Primary Project**: Cloud PACS development
- **Constraint Priority**: 0-byte Google Drive quota limitation

## Memory Skills Implemented
1. **memory_capture**: Daily session logging automation
2. **memory_consolidation**: Weekly intelligence curation
3. **memory_health**: System integrity monitoring
4. **preferences_extract**: Pattern learning from conversations
5. **continuity_bridge**: Cross-session context restoration

## Next Steps
- [ ] Set up automated heartbeat checks with memory review
- [ ] Implement session startup continuity protocol
- [ ] Test memory restoration on session restart
- [ ] Create project-specific memory tracking
- [ ] Build conversation history search capability
