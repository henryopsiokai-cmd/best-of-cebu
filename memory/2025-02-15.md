## Understanding Google Drive Limitations
- **Service Account Quota**: 0 bytes (prevents any file creation)
- **Folder Access**: Can read shared folders and files
- **File Discovery**: Can list and search existing content
- **Shared Folder Constraint**: Even shared folders consume service account quota

## Image Creation Capabilities (NEW!)
- **Tool**: ImageMagick 6.9.11-60
- **Created Samples**: 6 different images (gradients, textures, patterns, logos)
- **Capabilities**: Geometric shapes, colors, patterns, gradients, compositing
- **Limitations**: Text rendering (font issues), no canvas node access
