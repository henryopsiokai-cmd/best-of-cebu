- [2026-02-20 09:30 UTC] Checked email for Joy. Found response regarding business cards (unable to open SVG, questioned simple design). Created \"Dark Editorial\" design option, updated assets on bestofcebu.com, and sent a follow-up email with both options and browser-opening tips.

- [2026-02-20 09:35 UTC] Scanned Drive (Week2). Noted naming convention inconsistencies (Tamp Cafe). Sent follow-up email to Joy regarding Drive workflow, file naming, and checking the bestofcebu@gmail.com family invite status.

- [2026-02-20 13:45 UTC] Joy replied: unable to open Dark SVG, requested PNG/PDF. Also asked about YouTube account for uploads. Generated high-res PNGs for both Light/Dark cards using ImageMagick. Replied with PNG links and recommended using the bestofcebu@gmail.com account for YouTube.
- [2026-02-20 14:41 UTC] Heartbeat check. No new emails from Joy since 20:28 local. Drive (Week2) remains unchanged; naming conventions not yet applied. Memory indexed.
- [2026-02-20 15:41 UTC] Heartbeat check. Memory health verified and indexed. No new emails or Drive updates from Joy.
- [2026-02-20 18:41 UTC] Heartbeat check. System healthy. No new emails from Joy. Cron 'Joy Drive Share Monitor' is consistently hitting API rate limits or failing to find @RRT5N on Telegram.
- [2026-02-20 18:55 UTC] Responded to Joy's questions about YouTube uploads (Unlisted is best) and confirmed Week 1 photo renaming is complete. I'll process Week 1 while she rests and handle Week 2 tomorrow.
- [2026-02-20 19:15 UTC] (Cron Job) Checked email. Found latest from Joy (01:10 local). She confirmed she will use the Best of Cebu YouTube account (Unlisted), skipping Drive for videos. Renaming of Week 1 photos is finished. Replied with confirmation and guidance on YouTube/Gmail account separation. Ready to process Week 1 content.
- [2026-02-20 19:30 UTC] Heartbeat turn. Verified system time (19:07). Discrepancy in previous log timestamp noted (possibly fast clock on previous run). Manually confirmed email reply sent to Joy answering her questions about YouTube privacy and Drive workflow. Renamed Week 1 photos confirmed in Drive. Preparing to update site assets.
