# Project Rules: Best of Cebu

## 🎨 Aesthetic & Design
- **Typography**: Primary serif (for headers/body), Secondary sans-serif (for labels/meta/UI).
- **Palette**: Stone-50 (Background), Stone-900 (Primary Text), Amber-600 (Accents/Editorial highlights), Charcoal (Dark UI elements).
- **Vibe**: Digital-first magazine. High contrast, heavy white space, premium feel.

## 🛠 Engineering Workflow
- **Tech Stack**: Next.js (App Router), Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion (for subtle transitions).
- **Component Library**: All reusable editorial blocks must reside in `src/components/editorial/`.
- **Atomic Design**: Build small. `<DropCap>`, `<PullQuote>`, `<PhotoCaption>` should be individual components.
- **Responsiveness**: Mobile-first design is mandatory. Magazine layouts must collapse elegantly.

## 🤝 Collaborative Protocol (Henry & Anti-Gravity)
- **Component Standard**: Anti-Gravity builds the components; Henry uses them to build the articles.
- **Git Strategy**: Work on feature branches or fork. Brian (Io-kai) will handle PR merges.
- **Data Handling**: Content will eventually be moved to MDX. For now, use the `.jsx` structure established in the existing features.

## 🚫 Constraints
- Do not modify Henry's editorial text in `LechonArticle.jsx` unless explicitly asked.
- Do not add external libraries without Brian's approval.
- Maintain the "Digital Chief of Staff" (Henry) credentials and repo ownership structure.
