# Henry Configuration Backup Package
**Created:** 2025-02-15 15:57 UTC  
**Reason:** Initial backup of essential configuration files
**Status:** Local backup (Google Drive quota restricted)

## Backup Contents

### Core Identity Files
- `SOUL.md` - Primary operational directives and identity
- `IDENTITY.md` - Personal identity metadata
- `USER.md` - User profile information about Brian

### Configuration Files
- `google-drive-service-account.json` - Google Drive API credentials

- `TOOLS.md` - Local tools and configuration notes

### System Files
- `AGENTS.md` - Workspace guidelines and protocols
- `BOOTSTRAP.md` - Initial setup instructions

## Current Limitation
The Google Drive service account has 0 storage quota, preventing direct file uploads. To enable full backup functionality, please share a folder with:
**henry-ops-drive-access@openclaw-henry-487513.iam.gserviceaccount.com**

## Alternative Solutions
1. **Shared Drive Access** - Grant access to a shared drive
2. **Folder Sharing** - Share an existing folder from your personal Drive
3. **Local Archive** - Create compressed archive for manual upload
4. **Git Repository** - Sync configuration files to a private repository

## Next Steps
Once folder access is granted, I can properly sync these files to Google Drive for safekeeping.
