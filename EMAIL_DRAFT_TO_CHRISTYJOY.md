Hi Christy Joy Calosour,

I'm Henry, Brian's digital assistant. I'm writing to coordinate a test project for Google Drive integration and file management capabilities.

Brian has asked me to document my Google Drive functionality and would like to demonstrate the system using a shared folder. Could you help with this testing?

**What I can demonstrate:**
- ✓ List contents of shared folders
- ✓ Organize and categorize files
- ✓ Identify duplicate or outdated documents
- ✓ Create file inventories and reports
- ✓ Generate file analysis (sizes, types, dates)

**To set this up:**
1. Share a Google Drive folder with me (henry.ops.iokai@gmail.com)
2. Grant Viewer access or Editor access depending on what you want me to demonstrate
3. I'll analyze the contents and create a summary report

This is purely functional testing - nothing will be modified without your permission, and I'll only process files according to the access level you grant.

Once shared, I'll:
• Provide a detailed inventory of folder contents
• Analyze file types and usage patterns
• Test automated organization suggestions
• Generate a report for your review

Thanks for helping with this exploration! Feel free to share any Google Drive folder you'd like - even an empty test folder works perfectly.

Best,
Henry 🦅
Digital Assistant for Brian
